# Sumatras Studios Tools (Unreal Engine 5 Plugin)
Plugin for Unreal Engine 5. Evolving library of functions written to be used in projects. These are functions that I use myself, but are not elaborate enough to warrent a full plugin. 


## Installation
Download the latest version from the releases page and make sure that that you put the plugin in the plugins folder of your Unreal Engine Project. 



## Usage

To have the plugin work in a packaged project make sure to add the following to your DefaultEngine.ini (normally found Project/Config/DefaultEngine.ini )

```
[Plugins]
EnabledPlugins=Sumatras_Studios_Tools
```
