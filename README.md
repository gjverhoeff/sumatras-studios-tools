# Sumatras Studios Tools (Unreal Engine 5 Plugin)
Plugin for Unreal Engine 5. Evolving library of functions written to be used in projects. These are functions that I use myself, but are not elaborate enough to warrent a full plugin. 


## Installation
Download the latest release from the releases page for the packaged plugin or clone the this repository and add it to your plugins folder of your Unreal Engine project. Make sure to enable the plugin within your project. 


## Available Blueprint Nodes

More information about the nodes, formulas used, etc. on the wiki page of this repository
